# History of Drogheda #

This website was made to give people historic information of Drogheda, Co. Louth. 
For now we only look briefly at 3 landmarks: *St. Laurence's Gate,* *St. Dominic's Bridge,* *Millmount*
My site is targeted at people who like History and places that aren't as mainstream to visit.

   * The navigation background contrasts with the text color.
   * The links also react as the user hovers over it.
   * The links are also spaced out so they are easy to read.
