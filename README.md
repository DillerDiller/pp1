#History of Drogheda

This website was made to give people historic information of Drogheda, Co. Louth. 
For now we only look briefly at 3 landmarks *St. Laurence's Gate, *St. Dominic's Bridge, *Millmount.*
My site is targetedd at people who like History and places that aren't as mainstream to visit.
