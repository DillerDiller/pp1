# History of Drogheda #

This website was made to give people historic information of Drogheda, Co. Louth. 
For now we only look briefly at 3 landmarks: *St. Laurence's Gate,* *St. Dominic's Bridge,* *Millmount*
My site is targeted at people who like History and places that aren't as mainstream to visit.
