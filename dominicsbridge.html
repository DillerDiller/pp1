        <h2>St. Dominic's Bridge</h2>
        <p>
            THE oldest pedestrian bridge crossing the River Boyne in the vicinity of Drogheda today is that of Dominic`s Bridge; dating to the year 1863, this bridge was constructed in the area where the Scotch Hall Shopping Complex is located today and was made by the workers of Thomas Grendon's Iron Foundry. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking downstream from Dominic's bridge, one can clearly see that the River begins to narrow at this point and it was here, along both banks of the Boyne, that the old industries of Tanning, Salt works, Candle, Glue and Soap manufacturing took place in the vicinity of the old John and Dyer streets, but little is now known of the workforce that was employed here in the later 18th and 19th century.
